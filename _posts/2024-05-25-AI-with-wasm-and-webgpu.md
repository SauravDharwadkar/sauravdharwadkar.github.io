# Deploying AI Models on the Web Using WASM and WebGPU ( WIP)
 
## Introduction

WebAssembly (WASM) and WebGPU are revolutionizing AI model deployment on the web. WASM allows executing high-performance code in the browser, while WebGPU provides a low-level GPU API for accelerated computations. By leveraging these technologies, we can run AI models efficiently in the browser without relying on cloud inference.

In this article, we'll explore how to deploy AI models on the web using WASM and WebGPU, with practical examples using **Gemma 2 (TFLite)** and **Whisper.cpp (WASM)**.

## Why WASM and WebGPU for AI Deployment?

### Benefits of WASM:
- Near-native performance in the browser
- Secure sandboxed execution
- Runs across multiple platforms without dependencies
- Efficient memory usage

### Benefits of WebGPU:
- Direct access to modern GPU APIs (Vulkan, Metal, Direct3D 12)
- More efficient than WebGL for parallel computations
- Enables accelerated matrix operations crucial for AI inference

## Deploying AI Models with WASM and WebGPU

### 1. Running **Gemma 3 1b ** in the Browser

- [Whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) is a lightweight, C++ implementation of OpenAI’s Whisper model. It is optimized for on-device speech recognition and can run entirely in the browser using WebAssembly.


## Conclusion
Deploying AI models in the browser using **WASM and WebGPU** enables efficient, on-device inference without relying on cloud services. **Gemma 3 ** and **Whisper.cpp with WebGPU acceleration** are great examples of how this technology can bring AI directly to users’ browsers.

With further optimizations, such as GPU-accelerated quantization and threading improvements, WebAssembly and WebGPU will continue to make AI inference on the web even more powerful.
